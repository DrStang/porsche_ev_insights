# Glossary

A reference guide to electric vehicle terminology and terms used in Porsche EV Insights.

## Battery and Charging

### Battery Capacity

The amount of energy a battery can store, measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh). Porsche EVs typically have batteries ranging from 79.2 kWh to 105 kWh gross capacity.

**Gross vs. Usable:** Gross capacity is the total battery size. Usable capacity is the portion accessible for driving (typically 90-95% of gross), as some is reserved for battery management and longevity.

### Charge Cycle

One instance of charging the vehicle. In this dashboard, a charge cycle is defined by the "Since Charge" export, which tracks data from one charge to the next.

### Full Charging Cycle

The equivalent of using 100% of your battery capacity. If you use 50% of battery capacity twice, that equals one full cycle. This metric helps understand total battery throughput.

### Regenerative Braking (Regen)

A system that recovers kinetic energy during braking and coasting, converting it back to electricity to recharge the battery. This is why EVs are often more efficient in stop-and-go traffic than steady highway driving.

### State of Charge (SoC)

The current charge level of the battery as a percentage. For example, 80% SoC means the battery has 80% of its usable capacity available.

### Preconditioning

Heating or cooling the battery and cabin while the vehicle is still plugged in. This uses grid power instead of battery power, preserving range and ensuring optimal battery temperature for driving.

### Charging Loss

Energy lost during the charging process, typically 10-15% for AC charging. This energy converts to heat rather than being stored in the battery.

### Off-Peak Charging

Charging during periods when electricity demand (and often prices) are lower, typically overnight. Many utilities offer time-of-use rates with significant discounts during off-peak hours.

## Consumption and Efficiency

### Consumption

The amount of energy used per unit of distance. In metric, expressed as kWh/100km (lower is better). In imperial, often expressed as mi/kWh (higher is better) or kWh/mi (lower is better).

### WLTP

Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure. A standardized testing protocol used to measure vehicle range and consumption. WLTP figures are measured in laboratory conditions and are typically more optimistic than real-world results.

### Real-World Range

The actual distance a vehicle can travel on a full charge under real driving conditions. Typically 70-85% of WLTP range due to factors like climate control, driving style, and road conditions.

### Range Efficiency

The percentage of WLTP range achieved in real-world driving. Calculated as (Actual Range / WLTP Range) x 100.

### Sweet Spot

The speed range where an EV achieves optimal efficiency. For most EVs, this is typically 40-70 km/h, where aerodynamic drag is low but regenerative braking opportunities exist.

### Hypermiling

Driving techniques aimed at maximizing efficiency, such as gentle acceleration, anticipating stops, and maintaining steady speeds.

## Vehicle Specifications

### Performance Battery (PB)

Porsche's standard battery option, typically with smaller capacity (79.2 kWh gross in Taycan).

### Performance Battery Plus (PB+)

Porsche's larger battery option, offering more range (105 kWh gross in Taycan).

### J1 Platform

Porsche's dedicated electric vehicle platform, used by the Taycan and shared with the Audi e-tron GT.

**J1.1:** First generation (2019-2023)
**J1.2:** Updated version with improved efficiency and features (2024+)

### PPE Platform

Premium Platform Electric. Porsche's newer EV platform used by the Macan Electric and Cayenne Electric, developed jointly with Audi.

### RWD

Rear-wheel drive. A configuration where only the rear wheels receive power. Often the most efficient configuration.

### AWD / 4

All-wheel drive. A configuration where all four wheels receive power through front and rear electric motors. Taycan "4" models use AWD.

## Environmental Terms

### CO2 (Carbon Dioxide)

The primary greenhouse gas produced by burning fossil fuels. EVs produce zero direct CO2 emissions, though electricity generation may produce CO2 depending on the grid mix.

### Grid CO2 Intensity

The amount of CO2 produced per unit of electricity generated, measured in grams per kWh (g/kWh). Varies significantly by region based on the energy sources used.

### Well-to-Wheel Emissions

Total emissions from energy extraction through vehicle use. For EVs, this includes power plant emissions. For petrol cars, it includes extraction, refining, and combustion.

### Tailpipe Emissions

Emissions produced directly by the vehicle. EVs have zero tailpipe emissions, while petrol cars emit CO2, NOx, and particulates.

### Carbon Footprint

The total CO2 emissions associated with an activity or product. For vehicles, this includes manufacturing, operation, and disposal.

## Trip Categories

### Micro Trip

A trip under 5 km. These trips typically have the worst efficiency because the battery and motor don't reach optimal operating temperature.

### Short Trip

A trip between 5-10 km. Still affected by cold-start inefficiency but better than micro trips.

### Medium Trip

A trip between 10-20 km. Generally represents a baseline efficiency level.

### Long Trip

A trip between 20-50 km. Often shows improved efficiency as systems reach optimal temperature.

### Very Long Trip

A trip over 50 km. Usually the most efficient per-kilometer due to steady-state operation, though high-speed highway sections may reduce this advantage.

## Financial Terms

### Cost per Kilometer/Mile

The fuel/energy cost to travel one unit of distance. EVs typically cost 2-5x less per km/mile than equivalent petrol vehicles.

### Petrol Equivalent

The hypothetical cost if the same trips were made in a petrol vehicle, used for comparison purposes.

### Total Savings

The cumulative difference between petrol equivalent cost and actual electricity cost.

### Savings Rate

The percentage reduction in fuel costs compared to a petrol equivalent, typically 50-75% for EVs.

## Units of Measurement

### kWh (Kilowatt-hour)

A unit of energy equal to one kilowatt of power used for one hour. Used to measure battery capacity and energy consumption.

### kW (Kilowatt)

A unit of power equal to 1,000 watts. Used to measure charging speed and motor output.

### km/h (Kilometers per hour)

Speed measurement used in metric regions.

### mph (Miles per hour)

Speed measurement used in imperial regions (UK, US).

### L/100km (Liters per 100 kilometers)

Fuel consumption measurement used in metric regions. Lower is better.

### MPG (Miles per gallon)

Fuel economy measurement used in imperial regions. Higher is better. Note: UK and US gallons differ in size.

### g/kWh (Grams per kilowatt-hour)

Unit for measuring carbon intensity of electricity generation.

## Dashboard-Specific Terms

# Efficiency Tab

The Efficiency tab provides deep analysis of your energy consumption, helping you understand what factors affect your efficiency and where you can improve.

## Purpose

This tab answers questions like:
- How efficient is my driving compared to the WLTP rating?
- What were my best and worst trips?
- How does speed affect my consumption?
- Does the season impact my efficiency?
- Are short trips hurting my efficiency?

## Stat Cards

Three prominent cards highlight your efficiency extremes:

### Best Trip

Your most efficient trip (lowest consumption). Shows:
- Date of the trip
- Distance traveled
- Consumption rate (e.g., 18.5 kWh/100km)
- Average speed

To provide meaningful comparisons, only trips of 10 km or longer are considered for best/worst calculations. Shorter trips have too much variation from startup conditions.

### Fleet Average

Your overall average consumption across all trips. This is the most representative number for your typical driving efficiency.

### Worst Trip

Your least efficient trip (highest consumption). Same details as best trip. Understanding why this trip was inefficient can help improve future driving.

## Charts

### Consumption Trend

A line chart showing your consumption over time. The X-axis shows the time period (day, week, or month), and the Y-axis shows consumption in your chosen format.

A shaded "optimal efficiency domain" band (typically 15-40 kWh/100km) helps visualize when you're driving efficiently vs. when consumption is elevated.

**What to look for:**
- Trips above the optimal band may indicate:
  - Cold weather conditions
  - Aggressive driving
  - Heavy use of climate control
  - Short trips with cold battery
- Seasonal patterns (winter typically shows higher consumption)
- Improvement trends as you learn efficient driving techniques

### Consumption by Speed Range

A bar chart showing average consumption at different speed ranges:

| Speed Range | Typical Efficiency |
|-------------|-------------------|
| 0-20 km/h | Highest consumption (stop-and-go traffic) |
| 20-40 km/h | High consumption (city driving) |
| 40-60 km/h | Often the sweet spot |
| 60-80 km/h | Still efficient |
| 80+ km/h | Higher consumption (highway speeds) |

**What to look for:**
- Your personal "sweet spot" speed range
- The efficiency penalty of very low speeds (traffic, parking)
- How highway driving affects your range

**Why this matters:**

EVs have a different efficiency curve than combustion cars. Traditional cars are most efficient at highway speeds, while EVs often achieve best efficiency at moderate urban/suburban speeds (40-70 km/h) due to:
- Regenerative braking in varied traffic
- No idle losses when stopped
- Lower aerodynamic drag at lower speeds

### Seasonal Efficiency

A colored bar chart comparing consumption across seasons:

| Season | Months | Color |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Spring | March-May | Green |
| Summer | June-August | Yellow/Orange |
| Autumn | September-November | Orange |
| Winter | December-February | Blue |

**What to look for:**
- Winter typically shows 10-30% higher consumption due to:
  - Battery heating requirements
  - Cabin heating
  - Denser cold air (aerodynamic drag)
  - Less regenerative braking on icy roads
- Summer may show higher consumption in hot climates due to air conditioning
- Your personal seasonal variation percentage

### Consumption by Trip Type

A bar chart showing average consumption for each trip category:

| Trip Type | Distance | Typical Efficiency |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Micro | <5 km | Worst (cold battery, no regen opportunity) |
| Short | 5-10 km | Poor |
| Medium | 10-20 km | Baseline |
| Long | 20-50 km | Good |
| Very Long | >50 km | Often best (warmed up, steady speeds) |

**What to look for:**
- The efficiency penalty of micro/short trips
- Whether your long trips are actually more efficient
- Opportunities to combine short trips

## Understanding the Numbers

### What's a Good Consumption?

This varies significantly by vehicle model. Some benchmarks:

| Vehicle | WLTP Rating | Real-World Typical |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Taycan RWD | 17.8 kWh/100km | 20-24 kWh/100km |
| Taycan 4S | 19.4 kWh/100km | 22-26 kWh/100km |
| Taycan Turbo S | 21.6 kWh/100km | 24-30 kWh/100km |
| Macan Electric | 18.7 kWh/100km | 21-25 kWh/100km |

Real-world consumption is typically 15-30% higher than WLTP ratings due to:
- Real traffic conditions
- Climate control usage
- Personal driving style
- Actual road conditions

### Factors That Increase Consumption

**Weather:**
- Cold temperatures (battery heating, cabin heating)
- Hot temperatures (air conditioning)
- Rain (rolling resistance)
- Wind (aerodynamic drag)

**Driving style:**
- Aggressive acceleration
- Hard braking (wastes regen opportunity)
- High speeds

**Conditions:**
- Short trips (no warmup benefit)
- Hills and elevation changes
- Cargo weight
- Roof racks or accessories

### Factors That Improve Efficiency

- Moderate, steady speeds (40-70 km/h)
- Anticipating traffic (smooth driving)
- Using regenerative braking effectively
- Preconditioning while plugged in
- Proper tire pressure
- Longer trips (warmed-up systems)

## Tips for Improving Efficiency

1. **Combine short trips** - A single 15 km trip is more efficient than three 5 km trips
2. **Precondition while charging** - Heat/cool the cabin before unplugging
3. **Use seat heating over cabin heating** - Uses less energy in winter
4. **Moderate your speed** - The difference between 100 km/h and 130 km/h on the highway can be 20-30% more consumption
5. **Use Eco mode** - When range matters more than performance
6. **Check tire pressure** - Low pressure increases rolling resistance
7. **Remove roof racks when not in use** - Reduces aerodynamic drag
